 ## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

response = requests.get(STOCK_ENDPOINT, params=stock_params)
response.raise_for_status()
data = response.json()['Time Series (Daily)']
data_list = [value for (key, value) in data.items()]
yesterday_data = data_list[0]

day_before_yesterday_closing_price = (day_before_yesterday_data["4. close"])
print(f"The price of {STOCK_NAME} closed at a price of {day_before_yesterday_closing_price} the day before yesterday")

#TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp

difference = abs(float(yesterday_closing_price) - float(day_before_yesterday_closing_price))

percentage_difference = (difference / float(yesterday_closing_price)) * 100

#TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").

# if percentage_difference > 5:
#     print("Get News")



    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/ 
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 

#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

if percentage_difference > 0:
    # print("Get News")
    news_response = requests.get(NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_params)
    news_response.raise_for_status()
    news_data = news_response.json()["articles"]


#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation

    three_articles = news_data[:3]
    print(three_articles)


    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

    for article in three_articles:
        # formatted_articles = [f"Headline: {article['title']}. \nBrief: {article['description']}" for article in three_articles]
        article['description'] = article['description'].replace('‚Äú', '"')
        article['description'] = article['description'].replace('‚Äú', '"')
        article['description'] = article['description'].replace('‚Äù', '"')
        article['description'] = article['description'].replace('‚Ä¶', '...')
        formatted_articles = [f"Headline: {article['title']}. \nBrief: {article['description']}"]
    formatted_articles = formatted_articles
    print(formatted_articles)
    
#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.
    with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com") as connection:
        connection.starttls()
        connection.login(MY_EMAIL, MY_PASSWORD)
        connection.sendmail(

            to_addrs=MY_EMAIL,
            msg=f"Subject: Tesla News\n\n {formatted_articles}"
        )

#Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
